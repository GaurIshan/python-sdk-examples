I understand that you would like to secure the Security Group rules attached to your EMR Cluster to better control the access for your cluster. You were specifically concerned about unrestricted access on the Outbound Rules on your Security Group.

“Currently the recommended configuration by our EMR team for managed security group egress rules is 0.0.0.0/0” - This is both during the cluster launch and when the cluster is running. It is not advisable to restrict this especially during the cluster launch itself as it makes the EMR unable to download the applications (uses HTTP protocol to dowload the repository and packages) required and thus end in Cluster provision failure.https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-man-sec-groups.html

Also, your cluster needs to have connectivity to services like S3 and DynamoDB to download repos,upload/download logs, cluster information etc.... And if you are going to access any additional applications, you would have to open outbound rules to those endpoints as well. For eg, if you are going to use encryption, you would have to open 443 for KMS endpoints.

Outbound Rules on your Security Group is only applicable whenever your cluster nodes initiates new connections to external IP's (i.e., any IP's and not localhost/its own private IP). This is the reason why we provide unrestricted access to outbound connections as they are initiated by the node itself. If you would like to restrict access such that your nodes can talk to only services that you know they would then you can configure rules accordingly.

I have checked the logs for the EMR cluster j-24MD99O88C3F launched in public subnet in your environment and unfortunately I could not find the logs in the S3 bucket (this is because the EMR instances does not have internet access to connect to S3 service - no VPC endpoint and no outbound rules).

I tried to reproduce the issue at my end without the HTTP rules and noticed below exception in my case. As you can see below, there are connection timeout to connect through HTTP protocol to access the EMR / Linux repositories and packages.

1) How many files are been downloaded using rule "HTTP - TCP-80-0.0.0.0/0"

Multiple packages and repositories as seen above are downloaded and installed through this HTTP call. 

2) If we need to place those downloaded files in our repo and make the Datapipeline to use the files from that repo instead of downloading from internet , what would be the proxy url that needs to be changed.

The issue is specific to the EMR cluster launch failure. So the EMR service downloads the Linux repository and packages during the EMR cluster provision and requires HTTP 80 port to be opened to download the packages. 

I tested this at my end and could not succeed in launching EMR cluster without this outbound rule. Unfortunately, I do not find an alternative on this regard. 

Can this be tested by opening the HTTP ports until the EMR cluster provision successfully? Once the EMR provision is successful, you can try removing the HTTP rule and see if it helps. 

This is required during the EMR cluster provision. However you may update the security group rules later after the cluster has been launched successfully. I have directed in my previous response on the necessary access / networking setup required for the EMR cluster launch. Can you please discuss this with your network team and see if they can check further.
